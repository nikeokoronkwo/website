# Spurte

Spurte is frontend tooling used for developing powerful and maintainable web applications using the Dart programming language.

With Spurte, you can write modern web applications with the expressiveness, type-safety and structure of the [Dart programming language](https://dart.dev), with easy plugin integration, hot-module replacement, css validation,  production serving of application build, and support for [sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/).

## Upcoming Features
These are upcoming features currently worked on, and contributions would be wanted.
- [ ] [JS Integration](https://github.com/nikeokoronkwo/jsigen): One of Spurte's superpowers (and needed feature for 1.0 release) is the ability to integrate JavaScript into your project. In order to develop such features, Spurte depends on [`jsigen`](https://github.com/nikeokoronkwo/jsigen), a Dart tool for auto-generating bindings for Dart for JavaScript code.
